# hello ðŸ‘‹

This is my little language learning repositoryâ€”an experiment in project-based learning. While every language is a unique little snowflake, there are still common use cases that (almost!) every language should support. By implementing each use case, one can be reasonably sure that they understand the language.

## Mise

Never underestimate the amount of time you can waste installing tools! (I'm lookin' at you, Ruby ðŸ˜’). [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise) makes it much easier to manage different language runtimes at the system and directory level and I **strongly** recommend leveraging it with this repository. I've set the runtimes that I'm testing against in [mise.toml](./mise.toml).
