# mind reader

Can you identify the hidden word by saving the man from hanging?

- [ ] Randomly choose a word
- [ ] Collect letters from the user
- [ ] If the user guesses wrong 6 times, they lose
- [ ] If the user guesses all the letters of the word, they win

```zsh
./hangman
----------- (1/6) [T A C _] ------------
What letter would you like to try next?
o
```
